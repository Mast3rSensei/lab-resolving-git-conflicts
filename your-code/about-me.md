My name is Matteo, from Italy. I work in Accenture as a Content Moderator, and I had previous experience with Data Science and Python thanks to online courses.
I'm here because I always thought that simple self-study won't let me to enter the Data Science job market , that I need some sort of title that actually prove my skill out there.
I expect to learn how to create tools from scratch that allow me to gather and analyze data, as well as using statistical analysis to come to conlcusions about the data.
I still not sure if I'll use my new acquired skills in my current job or look for another one. I look at myself in the future as a sort of consultant that helps companies or privates to leverage Data Analytics for their good.
